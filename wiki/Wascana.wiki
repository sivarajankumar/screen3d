== Download Wascana ==

Download the installer at this link :

http://sourceforge.net/projects/wascana/files/Wascana%2C%20MinGW%20Edition/0.9.3/wascana-mingw-0.9.3.exe/download

== Install Wascana ==

Launch the installer _wascana-mingw-0.9.3.exe_

Continue until *Select Destination Location* window. Change the folder from _C:\Program Files\Wascana_ to _C:\Wascana_.

We do this because there are some problems with spaces, notably during compilation of Xerces with MSYS.

Then continue and finish the installation.

== First launch ==

Launch Wascana.

The first thing Wascana asks is to choose a workspace. Enter a path in which you want the workspace to be placed. For all Screen developments, we will use this unique workspace.

Then validate the workspace and you arrive on the main Wascana window.

If it is not, select the C++ view.

In next parts, we configure a project for Screen/Main pack. Other pack configuration are similar.
